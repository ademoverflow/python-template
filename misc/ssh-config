# This file is mounted on the container as ~/.ssh/config.
# Its only purpose is to get custom Host for git, in case you have multiple Hosts on your machine for ssh connections.
# For now, vscode only forwards ssh-agent to the container, but not the config file.
# Here is the exact issue on GitHub https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/5026
# So, if you have multiple Hosts for github, you can add them here.

Host github-antipode
    HostName github.com
